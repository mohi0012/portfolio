                    <p><b>2 AM BLUES</b> is a brand that focuses on unwinding and resting. 
                    We all have those moments where we come home from a long day of work and play, and all we want to do is kick our shoes off, lean into a cup of warm tea and fall asleep until the sunrise. Some days we even forget our whole night time routine because of how jam-packed our days are. </p>

                <p><i>What does your night time routine look like?</i></p>
                <br>
                <p>It could be anything that allows the space for downtime. From restless nights to early morning rises, we understood one thing and it’s that prioritizing rest and sleep is so difficult and yet so crucial to our livelihoods. 2 AM BLUES puts focus on products that promote unwinding and resting while giving more priority over that part of our lives.</p>

                <p><b>2 AM BLUES</b> originated from a space of restlessness and questioning the mind set of “sleep is for the weak.” When we decide that rest and sleep is no longer a priority of ours, we start to add more pressure on ourselves without understanding how to recharge. Our bodies need rest and sleep to get through the days without crashing. 
                    Once the crashing part came through, I knew that there was something that I needed to do. And that was to prioritize my night time routine and understand how important it was to the tasks that I needed to complete during the day. I wanted this night time routine to feel good while looking my best going to bed. 
                    This feeling of release and rest, I wanted others to experience it as well. </p>
