This portfolio focuses on my brand. I have been working towards building something that each and every individual can cater to when they are in need of rest and sleep. I wanted to create a website that features the very elements to the brand. From the logo to captivating photos and meaningful messages on what rest and sleep does for us, I believe that it can help reach my target audience. 

I've learned many things throughout this assignment process and amongst those things:

1) Understanding how to grid your layouts can be helpful and life-saving

2) Choosing a font that is easy to read, navigate and also appealing to the whole website can be great, too 

In the mist of it all, the challenges that I did face were: 

- creating a responsive website with mobile + tablet, as it focuses on a step by step process, and at times, if you're not too careful, you might miss a few steps and would need to look through the code to see what went wrong, and how to fix it 

- learning how to properly structure the layout and frame of the website. If there isn't a foundation to work with, it can be a complete mess and it won't look appealing and responsive

Overall, practice makes progress and that is something I wish to focus on as the days go by. Learning the very foundation of a website can be tricky but understanding the step by step process and how to create a responsive and appealing website.
